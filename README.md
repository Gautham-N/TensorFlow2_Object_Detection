# TensorFlow2_Object_Detection
End to End implementation of Object Detection using TensorFlow2 and QT Creator

The Details are as follows:
I have used google colab platform for training and the model I have chosen is faster_rcnn_resnet50_keras.
I have deployed the model on an Edge PC that is on a Laptop which consists of CPU Intel i5-core through C++ Application.
I have used Tensorflow CAPI for inferencing.
